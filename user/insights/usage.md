title: Using Travis Insights Effectively

Travis Insights is designed to connect to every piece of your development and operations tooling to pull useful insights from every detail of the environment. In general, the more connections you make by integrating the systems you use with Travis Insights, the more valuable and meaningful the data and insights will be. 

## Best Practices
Where possible, ensure that API keys used for Travis Insights integration only have **_read-only_** access to your systems.

Integrate every tool in your environment, from source code management to production monitoring. Travis Insights needs a complete picture of your environment to audit it effectively. 

If the integration for your tool does not yet exist, [let us know!](mailto:feedback@srenity.io) (feedback@srenity.io)

## Integrations
We offer a variety of integrations ([see our architecture documentation](../architecture/#categories)) that cover the various aspects of your DevOps toolchain. Every category of integration has an important place in ensuring the robustness and stability of your environment. If you do not have tooling currently set up for one of the categories, you should consider adding it to ensure you have a more thorough cover and protection for potential issues.

If you have some important tooling that you think we've missed, [let us know!](mailto:feedback@srenity.io) (feedback@srenity.io)

## Audit and Environment Review
Travis Insights is an excellent tool for ensuring compliance with best practices and running automated environment audits. Whether it's HIPPA, SOX, PCI, or simply an interest in making sure that you're securing best practices (not leaving security groups too open or leaving machines running at low usage), Travis Insights can quickly identify problems that might otherwise go unnoticed. Review your dashboard regularly to ensure that things are still running as expected.

Every company has an "Ops budget", whether that's the time of a whole team of expert SREs and DevOps engineers or a few hours a week of the most senior dev at a startup. Travis Insights helps you quickly size up your environment and prioritize the most impactful way to spend that budget.
