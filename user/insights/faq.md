### Why is the option to edit JSON queries is disabled?

Travis Insights generates sample JSON after the scan. If the scan fails, JSON queries will be missing. 

### Why are the Default probes not generated?

Default probes for a specific plugin are created if there are no other related probes. To generate default probes, delete the existing probes, delete the plugin, and re-add the plugin.

### What can be done with the JSON queries?

With JSON queries, you can create notifications. 

### Why, after scanning the plugin, can I not see JSON queries?

Check your API key rights are assigned well

### Why do scans fail?

Most of the time, scans fail because of wrong configurations. Before reporting, check if domain, keys, plugins, or credentials are added correctly.

### When and why do I receive email notifications?

Travis Insights sends an email once a programmed or manual scan is complete.
