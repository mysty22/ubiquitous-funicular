After adding a plugin, Travis Insights runs a scan process automatically. Scans also run each day at a determined time, or you can run new scans manually with the **RUN NEW SCAN** button located at the top of the dashboard.

After pressing the **RUN NEW SCAN** button, a notification will appear at the top of your [dashboard](https://srenitydashboard.io/dashboard/index), letting you know that your data is in the process of being updated.

Once the scan completes, you receive an e-mail letting you know the scan is complete, and all the information is updated dynamically in the dashboard, including notifications and ratings.

On the [Plugins](https://srenitydashboard.io/plugins) page, you can see the scan status. You will find the following statuses:

  - **Successful:** All plugin probes were able to run successfully.
  - **Partial:** Some of the plugin probes failed during the scan.
  - **Error:** The system encountered an issue that didn't let Travis Insights finish the scan. 
  - **In Progress:** The probes scan is taking place.

> A scan process can last **10 minutes** maximum. When the scanning time exceeds this, the process will end with an error status.
